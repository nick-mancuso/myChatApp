My live chat app can be found at https://chat-app-233ed.web.app/. Note that you can deep link to a particluar channel or server like so: https://chat-app-233ed.web.app/?channel=new&server=main

When you first visit the app, you will (hopefully) see the login page:

Login or create an account using the provided forms. also note that if you forget your password, you can recover it from this form. Once you have logged in, you will see the chat window appear:

Administrators have the ability to delete (but not edit) other's messages; only you (the user) can delete and edit your own messages. Both of these operations can be accomplished by clicking on the "x" and the pencil icon, respectively.

Logging out can be accomplished by cliking on the gear icon on the bottom left side of the chat window.
